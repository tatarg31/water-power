<section id="filters">
  <h2>Filter Modules</h2>
  <div class="card"><b>Pre‑Filter:</b> The pre‑filtration stage is the first physical barrier in the Water Power system. It removes visible particles such as sand, sediment, insects, plant matter, and debris that could clog or damage downstream filters. This stage significantly extends the lifespan of later modules and reduces maintenance frequency.</div>
  <div class="card"><b>Biological Filter:</b> Water passes through a bio‑media chamber containing controlled, non‑pathogenic bacterial colonies. These bacteria break down organic pollutants and reduce harmful microorganisms, mimicking natural purification processes found in wetlands and rivers.</div>
  <div class="card"><b>Activated Carbon:</b> Highly porous carbon media adsorbs chlorine, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), pesticides, industrial chemicals, odors, and certain heavy metals. This stage improves both safety and taste.</div>
  <div class="card"><b>Reverse Osmosis:</b> A semi‑permeable membrane removes dissolved salts, microplastics, nitrates, pharmaceuticals, and chemical pollutants. This stage enables desalination and advanced purification, activating only when sensor data indicates it is necessary.</div>
  <div class="card"><b>pH Control:</b> A mineral‑based cartridge restores water to a safe, neutral pH range after intensive filtration. This improves taste, supports health, and prevents corrosion.</div>
</section>

<section id="efficiency">
  <h2>Efficiency & Energy Design</h2>
  <div class="card">Water Power is engineered to minimize energy use while maintaining high purification performance. Sensor‑guided filtration ensures that only the necessary treatment stages activate, preventing wasted power and unnecessary filter degradation.</div>
  <div class="card">The system supports rechargeable battery operation, low‑energy standby modes, and optional solar charging compatibility. These features make Water Power suitable for off‑grid locations, disaster response, and regions with unreliable electricity access.</div>
</section>

<section id="sustainability">
  <h2>Our Commitment to Sustainability</h2>
  <div class="card">Sustainability is central to Water Power's design philosophy. Instead of disposable, single‑use filters, the system uses replaceable and modular cartridges that extend the device's operational lifespan.</div>
  <div class="card">Durable housing materials, repairable components, and reduced dependence on bottled water help lower long‑term environmental impact. The goal is to provide clean water access without creating new waste or pollution challenges.</div>
</section>

<section id="you">
  <h2>Water Power and You</h2>
  <div class="card">Water Power prioritizes transparency and user empowerment. Users are informed about water quality, treatment stages, and system limitations, allowing them to make informed decisions about their water use.</div>
  <div class="card">There are no hidden subscriptions, misleading claims, or undisclosed treatment methods. Unlike past water treatment controversies, Water Power emphasizes ethical communication and responsible use.</div>
</section>

<section id="who">
  <h2>Who It's For</h2>
  <div class="card">Water Power is designed to serve diverse users, including rural and remote communities, urban low‑income neighborhoods, disaster‑affected areas, refugee camps, travelers, outdoor enthusiasts, and emergency preparedness kits.</div>
  <div class="card">Community and humanitarian deployments are coordinated with governments, NGOs, and charities to ensure responsible distribution. Individual models are distributed through partnerships with outdoor and emergency brands.</div>
</section>

<section id="lifecycle">
  <h2>Lifecycle & Waste Responsibility</h2>
  <div class="card">Water Power is designed with a full lifecycle approach, meaning responsibility does not end once contaminants are removed from water. Spent pollutants are captured inside a sealed waste cartridge that is physically separated from clean‑water components. This cartridge is reinforced using industrial sealing techniques such as ultrasonic welding and resin encapsulation to prevent leaks or accidental exposure.</div>
  <div class="card">Once a cartridge reaches the end of its service life, it is removed intact and collected through authorized return programs. Licensed waste processors assess the cartridge contents for regeneration, material recovery, or controlled disposal. Regenerable materials such as activated carbon may be reprocessed, while hazardous or radioactive materials are handled according to strict environmental and safety regulations.</div>
  <div class="card">By treating filtration waste as a managed industrial by‑product rather than disposable trash, Water Power minimizes environmental harm and ensures that sustainability extends beyond the point of use.</div>
</section>

<section id="limitations">
  <h2>Limitations & Responsible Use</h2>
  <div class="card">While Water Power is designed to treat a wide range of contaminants, it is not a universal solution for every possible water condition. Extremely high concentrations of industrial toxins, untreated nuclear waste, or unknown chemical mixtures may exceed the system's safe operating limits.</div>
  <div class="card">Water Power does not replace large-scale municipal treatment infrastructure. Instead, it is intended as a decentralized, supplemental solution for communities, individuals, and emergency contexts where centralized treatment is unavailable or unreliable.</div>
  <div class="card">The system relies on timely cartridge replacement and responsible waste return programs. Failure to replace filters when indicated can reduce treatment effectiveness and may damage internal components.</div>
</section>

<section id="testimonials">

    const explanations = {
      "Raw Water Intake": "Water enters the Water Power system from available sources such as rivers, wells, rainwater harvesting systems, emergency storage tanks, or temporary surface water supplies. Sensors at this stage immediately begin measuring baseline water quality, including turbidity, temperature, pH, and potential chemical or radiological indicators. This initial data allows the system to decide which downstream filtration stages need to activate, preventing unnecessary energy use and filter wear.",

      "Debris & Insect Screen": "The debris and insect screen is a mechanical pre‑filtration stage designed to remove large physical contaminants such as insects, leaves, sand, silt, and other visible particles. This stage protects downstream filters from clogging and physical damage, extending their lifespan. By removing large solids early, the system improves overall efficiency and ensures that biological and chemical filters operate under optimal conditions.",

      "Biological Filter": "In the biological filtration stage, water passes through a bio‑media chamber that hosts carefully selected, non‑pathogenic bacterial colonies. These bacteria break down organic matter, reduce harmful microorganisms, and help neutralize biologically active pollutants. This process mimics natural water purification systems found in wetlands and rivers, offering an energy‑efficient and environmentally friendly method of treatment.",

      "Activated Carbon": "The activated carbon module uses high‑surface‑area carbon media to adsorb chemical contaminants. This includes chlorine, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), agricultural runoff chemicals, unpleasant tastes and odors, and certain heavy metals. The carbon stage plays a critical role in improving both water safety and sensory quality, making the water safer and more pleasant to drink.",

      "Reverse Osmosis": "Reverse osmosis (RO) is a high‑precision filtration stage that forces water through a semi‑permeable membrane. This membrane blocks dissolved salts, microplastics, pharmaceuticals, nitrates, and many industrial contaminants. RO is especially important in desalination scenarios and areas affected by chemical pollution. Because RO is energy‑intensive, Water Power activates this stage only when sensors detect contaminants that cannot be removed by earlier filters.",

      "pH Stabilisation": "After intensive filtration, water can become slightly acidic. The pH stabilisation stage passes water through a mineral cartridge containing calcium and magnesium‑based media. This gently restores the water to a safe, neutral pH range suitable for human consumption, while also improving taste and preventing corrosion in storage containers and plumbing.",

      "Clean Water Output": "Once all required treatment stages are complete, the purified water is directed to the clean water output. This may be a sealed storage tank, a dispensing tap, or a connection to community distribution systems. Final quality checks confirm that the water meets safety standards before it is made available for consumption."
